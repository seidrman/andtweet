AndTweet can be found on the Android Market. The instructions below are for installing the application directly on the phone without using the Market.

A very humble alpha version of the AndTweet twitter client is available for download here:
http://andtweet.googlecode.com/files/AndTweet-0.2.2.apk

## Installation instructions ##
The following instructions are for installing the application directly from a downloaded APK, for all other purposes, please download and install the application from the Android Market.
  1. Enable installation of non-Market applications by going to Settings > Applications and checking Unknown sources.
  1. Point your G1's browser to http://andtweet.googlecode.com/files/AndTweet-0.2.2.apk
  1. Install the application

Please have patience with my bumbling attempts at Java and Android, and I would greatly appreciate any and all bug reports, feature requests, and other suggestions.
